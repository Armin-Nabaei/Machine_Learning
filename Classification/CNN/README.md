### SVHN Classification Using My Proposed Model, Adaptive-Margin Softmax, and Modified-Adam Optimizer (Tensorflow) - Achieving 97.70% Test Accuracy

Our model demonstrates exceptional performance with a test accuracy of 97.70%, positioning our error rate at a mere 2.3%. This outcome is noteworthy, especially when compared to the error rates reported by state-of-the-art models and methodologies, which vary between 4.9% and 1.02%. This achievement underscores the effectiveness of our approach in tackling the challenges of SVHN classification.
